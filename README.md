 ## fsm_bump_go

### Nocom-pila's bump and go versions

We've made three files with different code. One corresponds to each version of the practice
1. Bump and go basic version (with only one spin)
2. Bump and go advanced (with two spin possibilities)
3. Bump and go laser (pro version using the base and the laser)

# 1. Bump and go basic
This version has only the code to make the kobuki spin to the left following a very simple states-machine
The possible states are:
- GOING_FORWARD
- GOING_BACK
- TURNING_LEFT
